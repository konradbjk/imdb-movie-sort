# Imdb-movie-manager
##This works only for Windows OS
This script will sort your movies into folders based on the IMDB rating.

First of all, put all your movies into a single folder.

Next, click Win+R to open Run Menu and type there:
~~~bash
shell:sendto
~~~
And paste there the *movie.cmd*. Now when you right click any file, you'll see an additional option 'send to movie.cmd'

Next copy the movie.py file to your C drive.

If you would like to change the path to the *movie.py* folder than you need to edit *move.cmd* file to change the path tho this script.

Finally right click the folder containing all your movies and send it to movie.cmd. Wait a few minutes and finally you'll see that all your movies have been sorted based on the IMDB rating.
